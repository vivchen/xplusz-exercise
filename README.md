This is a project done for a junior front-end developer role at X Plus Z.`

The main page is entitled dogs.html.

 The project makes use of Twitter Bootstrap 3 to achieve a responsive design. For form validation, Jquery Validation was used.
 
 My own css styling is located in dogs.css and my own js is in js/main.js.
